Vector fonts allow more efficient scaling, but for screens with resolution below 720p it might be worth considering bitmap fonts as they are generally more legible at smaller sizes on low-resolution screens.\n",

I compare our job to a health worker, to a craftsman, and I realize that we have a pretty easy job in most cases. Usually, nobody’s life will be affected if a website is not available for a couple of minutes or hours.  But there are some cases where this could happen. People start coding app interfaces for health application with web technologies, people start connecting health services to the web, and people also rely on websites for their own safety. And that’s why I think we should feel responsible for our users. And by making choices that are ethical and user-centered, we create a better web for everyone.",
